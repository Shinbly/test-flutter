By habit I started the documentation in english so all documentation will be in English.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The goal is to get some information from a JSON file and display it in a list.
the information look like a list of order and each order has a list of items.

it's specificaly requested to use a state management approach to separate all data management.
for that i will use riverpod package.
